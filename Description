Conducted binary classification to predict passenger satisfaction using supervised learning algorithms, 
achieving 96% accuracy with Random Forest, 83% accuracy with Naive Bayes, and 75% accuracy 
with Decision Trees. 
Utilized key features such as travel type, class (economy/business), and flight arrival/delay data to 
identify factors influencing passenger satisfaction. 
Analyzed and visualized the dataset to assist airlines in making data-driven decisions for service 
improvements and enhancing the overall passenger experience.
